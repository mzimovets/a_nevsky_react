# 0.3.0

* Rename the existing concept of a "style name" to "style ID" to correspond to
  the terminology used internally in docx files. Any document transforms that
  get or set the `styleName` property should use the `styleId` property instead.

* Allow paragraphs and runs to be matched by style name. For instance, to match
  a paragraph with the style name `Heading 1`:
  
    p[style-name='Heading 1']
    
* Use an array of raw strings rather than an array of style mappings when
  passing options to convertToHtml.

* Add support for node 0.11 (tested on node 0.11.13).

# 0.2.2

* Fix: exception when bad arguments are passed into unzip.openZip.

# 0.2.1

* Fix browserify support
